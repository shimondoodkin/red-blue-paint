# red-blue-paint

lets practice painting eyesight with regular computer, mouse and anaglyph (red and blue) 3d glasses

use: http://bit.ly/redbluepaint

press f11 for full screen.

use mouse to paint

cool things to paing are intersecting lines and intersecting lines of different colors and an interesting figure. all these enable the ye to find and lock on position. to challange eyes draw (maybe with smaller size) blue on red or with red on blue
on black background.

for example on black background draw a blue smilely. make it a spider by adding horizontal lines on sides of it. then add two vertical red lines on sides. 

mouse wheel to change size of point

* left click to draw blue
* middle button to draw red
* right click to draw black

* press 1 to clear screen blue
* press 2 to clear screen red 
* press 3 to clear screen black


makes alot of challange on brain of eyes. eyes basically say i feel stupid give me a break but you keep practice.

dichoptic eyesight taining is the latest reseach in eyesight.
after first practice of 15 minutes i got an effect of 1 to 2 dioptre eyesight enhancment.
it is said in several places the more training the more the effect. lots of practice makes the effect permanent.


it is posible because eyes if not desease are usually ok
but usually not trained to see well because looking at computer long time.
eyes usually can focus given some time but they vlur to connect both eyes emades beter so they dont focus.
all it needs just show brain good information.

eyes should be relaxed instead for this to work. tension in muscles bends the picture.
