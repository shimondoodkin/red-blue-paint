lets practice painting eyesight with regular computer, mouse and anaglyph (red and blue) 3d glasses

use: http://bit.ly/redbluepaint

press f11 for full screen.

use mouse to paint

cool things to paing are intersecting lines and intersecting lines of different colors and an interesting figure. all these enable the ye to find and lock on position. to challange eyes draw (maybe with smaller size) blue on red or with red on blue
on black background.

for example on black background draw a blue smilely. make it a spider by adding horizontal lines on sides of it. then add two vertical red lines on sides. 

mouse wheel to change size of point

* left click to draw blue
* middle button to draw red
* right click to draw black

* press 1 to clear screen blue
* press 2 to clear screen red 
* press 3 to clear screen black


makes a lot of challenge on brain of eyes. eyes basically say i feel stupid give me a break but you keep practice.

for more like this search:

* dichoptic training
* dichoptic Tetris

dichoptic eyesight training is the latest research in eyesight.
after first practice of 15 minutes i got an effect of 1 to 2 dioptre eyesight enhancement.
it is said in several places the more training the more the effect. lots of practice makes the effect permanent.


it is possible because eyes if not disease are usually ok
but usually not trained to see well because looking at computer long time.
eyes usually can focus given some time.  eyes are too crossed to the center for long distance and too outwards for short distances. and each eye has its own problems  disassociated with the other eye and for short distance there is one and another beyond your normal focal point.

but eyes blur defocus to connect both eyes images better.
all it needs just show brain good information.
to see the problem simply close one eye and see where you see one image switch eyes and see if you see the image in same place,(you should) if you don’t see it means you have some eyes crossing disorder which prevents learnign focus.
you can even train with a finger to see if you see same place picture in both eyes. closing the eyes resets the fusing of two pictures by brain. i cam hypothize that the fution of eyes depend on number brain has to care about because in distance there are more pixels so the more close matching of position is important.

one eyes book said eyes should be relaxed instead of squinting for this to work. tension in muscles bends the picture. i found that i need to control the position of eyes consciously and also this book said need to learn to see with whole eye.
so i found that my eye's shape is to see in center  from eye glasses. sometimes relaxing and seeing with whole eye works. Sometimes it don’t. I don’t understand it yet.
you shouldn't look through top of the eye rather from center notice this.

anyways matching position requirers practice.
